Pre-installation Instructions
=============================

   This installation requires the pre-installation of a C++ compiler, 
the cmake build system and the sdsl-lite library.

For Linux, you can install these libraries via

 $ ./pre-install.sh 

Basic Instructions
==================

   The shell command `make -f Makefile-sa.gcc' should compile the program making use of the suffix array. 
   The shell command `make -f Makefile-csa.gcc' should compile the program making use of the compressed suffix array. 
   The shell command `make -f Makefile-cst.gcc' should compile the program making use of the compressed suffix tree.
   The shell command `make -f Makefile-fm.gcc' should compile the program making use of the FM-index.
   
Depending on the compilation the binary `sa' or `csa' or `cst' or `fm' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via the following

 $ ./sa -h
 $ ./csa -h
 $ ./cst -h
 $ ./fm -h
