BDA-index_I and BDA-index_II
===

<b>Installation</b>: To install and compile BDA-index_I or BDA-index_II, read the INSTALL file within the BDA-index_I or BDA-index_II folders.

<b>Which index shall I use?</b> BDA-index_II is considerably faster in practice than BDA-index_I, especially when the number of occurrences is high; and then it is also smaller.
BDA-index_I has provably near-optimal queries but relies on a 2D range reporting data structure (based on wavelet trees) for the queries, which is very slow in practice.

<b>INPUT</b>: A file containing a single text and a file containing a set of patterns seperated by a new line.

<b>OUTPUT</b>: A file containing the set of patterns and the starting position of their occurrences within the text.


```
Usage: 
./bda-index_I <text_file> <ell> <pattern_file> <output_filename> <ram_use> <block_size> <index_filename>
./bda-index_II <text_file> <ell> <pattern_file> <output_filename> <ram_use> <block_size> <index_filename>

<text_file> - name of input text file.
<ell> - lower bound on the length of input patterns to consider. 
<pattern_file> - name of input file containing the patterns.
<output_filename> - name of output file, where pattern occurrences will be output.
<ram_use> - RAM usage for external SA and LCP array construction (Mbits).
<block_size> - size of block to use for constructing the bd-anchors (bytes).
<index_filename> - name of the index file to be used (if they exist) otherwise to be created.
```

<b>Examples</b>
```
 $ ./bda-index_I ./data/text 3 ./data/patterns out 1024 10 index
 $ ./bda-index_II ./data/text 3 ./data/patterns out 1024 10 index
```
