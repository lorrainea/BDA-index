EM-SparsePhi - external memory LCP array construction algorithm
===============================================================


Description
-----------

This package contains implementation of the external memory LCP array
construction algorithm called EM-SparsePhi. The algorithm is described
in the paper

  Juha Karkkainen and Dominik Kempa,
  Faster External Memory LCP Array Construction.
  In Proc. 24th European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA), 2016.

The latest version of EM-SparsePhi is available at:
  http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/pads/



Compilation and usage
---------------------

2. Compile EM-SparsePhi using the provided Makefile

   $ cd src
   $ make

This will produce two executables that allow computing the LCP array
of a given file sequentially and in parallel. For usage, run the
programs without any arguments. EM-SparsePhi relies on the prior
computation of suffix array for the input text. The suffix array for
big files can be computed e.g. using the pSAscan algorithm, see
https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/pads/pSAscan.html for more details.



Terms of use
------------

EM-SparsePhi is released under the MIT/X11 license. See the file LICENCE
for more details.
