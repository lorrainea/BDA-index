Pre-installation Instructions
=============================

   This installation requires the pre-installation of a C++ compiler, 
the cmake build system and the sdsl-lite library.

For Linux, you can install these libraries via

 $ ./pre-install.sh 

Basic Instructions
==================

   The shell command `make -f Makefile.32-bit.gcc' should compile this program using 32-bit integers. 
   The shell command `make -f Makefile.64-bit.gcc' should compile this program using 64-bit integers. 
   
After compilation the binary `bda-index_I' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via

 $ ./bda-index_I -h
